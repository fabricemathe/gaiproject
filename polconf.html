    <h1>Politique de confidentialité</h1>
    <p> 
        
    
    Myfabulousspace website is owned by Fablabs, which is a data controller of your personal data. <br>
    
    We have adopted this Privacy Policy, which determines how we are processing the information collected by Myfabulousspace, <br>
     which also provides the reasons why we must collect certain personal data about you. Therefore, <br>
       you must read this Privacy Policy before using Myfabulousspace website. <br>
    
    We take care of your personal data and undertake to guarantee its confidentiality and security. <br>
    
    Personal information we collect: <br>
    
    When you visit the Myfabulousspace, we automatically collect certain information about your device,  <br>
    including information about your web browser, IP address, time zone, and some of the installed cookies on your device. <br>
     Additionally, as you browse the Site, we collect information about the individual web pages or products you view, <br>
      what websites or search terms referred you to the Site, and how you interact with the Site.  <br>
      We refer to this automatically-collected information as “Device Information.” Moreover, <br>
      we might collect the personal data you provide to us (including but not limited to Name, Surname, Address, payment information, etc.)  <br>
      during registration to be able to fulfill the agreement.  <br>
    
    Why do we process your data? <br>
    
    Our top priority is customer data security, and, as such, we may process only minimal user data, only as much as it is absolutely necessary  <br>
    to maintain the website. Information collected automatically is used only to identify potential cases of abuse and  <br>
     establish statistical information regarding website usage. This statistical information is not otherwise aggregated  <br>
      in such a way that it would identify any particular user of the system.  <br>
    
    You can visit the website without telling us who you are or revealing any information, by which someone could identify you as a specific,  <br>
     identifiable individual. If, however, you wish to use some of the website’s features, or you wish to receive our newsletter or  <br>
     provide other details by filling a form, you may provide personal data to us, such as your email, first name, last name, city of residence,  <br>
      organization, telephone number. You can choose not to provide us with your personal data, but then you may not be able to take advantage  <br>
      of some of the website’s features. For example, you won’t be able to receive our Newsletter or contact us directly from the website.  <br>
       Users who are uncertain about what information is mandatory are welcome to contact us via fabricekulhe@myfabulousspace.com.  <br>
